  <p class="take">1. When we invent something, it becomes highly important to protect our invention. This is where IPR comes into the picture. IPR not only protects the invention but also ensures the safeguarding of the thought process that went into it and the labor that made the invention reach reality. When it comes to the company IPR increases the value of the company. The assets of the company are both intangible and tangible, the IPR comes under the intangible part. Also, the importance of IPR for the company increases when the case of a merger or company takeover comes into the picture.
    <br> <br><br>
    2. We have three major IPR laws, Patent, Trademark, and Copyright. Patents work majorly towards protecting Scientific inventions and inventions generally while Trademarks safeguard the name of the company from inappropriate usage. Finally, Copyrights are dominantly playing a major role in the case of media works. Multiple laws other than these are also present, one that was stated being the Law that protects geographical indication of goods which protects the origin of the goods when the good belongs to a certain place and is being sold outside the area. Further, there is a law called industrial design which protects the design of a specific product from being copied.
    <br><br><br>
    3. Applying for the patent is not as easy as it seems. We need to do a great ton of research work to ensure no one has already done the same thing for which we are seeking to apply a patent for. A proper database is always managed by the patent office always to ensure patent rights are followed. The patent office also works in the similar lines of
    <br><br><br>
    4. Whenever there are laws made to protect an idea, obviously there are laws also present to ensure that if these are infringed, there is proper compensation done. The patentee upon getting to know about the infringement of his/her product can apply before the controller at the patent office with the required document and details to bring to the notice of the controller about the patent infringement. If necessary, the controller will listen to both sides and if it is a case of infringement, necessary compensation will be provided to the rightful owner if damages are done. Also, there can be an order initiated by the controller to discontinue the making of a similar product by the person who initiated the infringement.
    <br><br><br>
    5. The major problem arising is the lack of awareness, this results in different people having different notions of infringement which further results in disputes where it becomes increasingly difficult to come to a proper conclusion. Also when it comes to infringement the damage is done or the motive to damage and infringe has to be proven which is very difficult at times.
    <br><br><br>
    6. With automation coming into the picture, it has become greatly easy to file a patent application as it can now be done both online and offline mode. Also, the difference in fee of both physical and online filling makes the online filling more likable by the public as it has lesser cost than general physical filling. The required time has also come done as a result of this. Further, the Patent office finds it increasingly easier to manage and go through documents in the online mode making the job easier at both ends and resulting in a win-win situation.
    <br><br><br>
    7. Proper provisions are present in case a person wants to protect their patent in multiple countries. Once the application is made in India, the same application can also be sent to other countries' patent offices to ensure that the patent is also protected in that country and vice versa.
    <br><br><br>
    8. There happen to be multiple treaties ensuring the protection of patents in numerous countries, some of them include the TRIPS agreement i.e., Trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. Also, there is another treaty known as the Bernie convention which is used to protect these aspects of patents between multiple countries.
    <br><br><br>
    9. Awareness can be created through regular competitions in schools and colleges, so it is highly necessary to inculcate the idea into actual learning to ensure people know about it. Further awareness can also result from people who know about it publishing articles stating the importance of such IPR
    <br><br><br>
    10. Laws already protect the rights of the owner so when the person realizes an infringement, they have to take proper action in proper duration. From authority point of view, they have to be quick with actions.
    <br><br><br>
    11. Speedy disposal of information along with efficiency in the patent process is highly desirable. Which in turn will increase awareness regrading IPR.
    <br><br><br>
    12. One to be noted is in the case of vaccines. The government procured multiple vaccine rights so that they could be easily accessible by the public.
